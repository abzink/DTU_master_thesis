# Machine Learning approach to product categorization in the manufacturing industry
## Master Thesis Project

This GitHub repository stores all the code developed during the project with Alfa Laval A/S. 

The code is written in Python 3.10.13 and the packages versions are listed in the **requirements.txt** file.

Three folders refer to different stages of the project:
1. **Data exploration and preprocessing** - 01_data_preparation
2. **Clustering and topic modeling** - 02_clustering
3. **Semi-supervised machine learning** - 03_ssl

Each folder contains both the code and the notebooks used to explore the code. Additionally, 00_testing folder includes all the testing and exploration within any of the stages above. 

**plotting_utils.py** is a function to save the figures.

Please refer to **.gitignore** file to see which folders are not included, namely data and figures because of their large size and data security reasons. 

**Note:** The code is in a working state, but it is not optimized for production. Final implmentation of the code is not included in this repository and will be done by Alfa Laval A/S.
