## Master Thesis Project

This GitHub repository stores all the code developed during the project with Alfa Laval A/S.

Three folders refer to different stages of the project:
1. **Data exploration and preprocessing** - 01_data_preparation
2. **Clustering and topic modeling** - 02_clustering
3. **Semi-supervised machine learning** - 03_ssl

Additionally, 00_testing folder includes all the testing and exploration within any of the stages above. 

**requirements.txt** outlines all the packages necessary to run the code.

**plotting_utils.py** codes a function to save the figures.

Please refer to **.gitignore** file to see which files are not included, namely data and figures because of their large size and data security reasons.
